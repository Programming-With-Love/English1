# 宾语从句

宾语从句：

* I don't know what to do. 
* I don't know which one is the best.
* 象这种有what, which, that引导句子在整个句子, 充当宾语成分.那就是宾语从句.
* 主语：I 
* 谓语：don't know 
* 宾语：what to do.

区别于 定语从句：

* I don't know the man who is wearing a pair of glass.
* 象这中由who, which, that, when 引导的句子在整个句子中做定语成分就叫定语从句.
* 主语：i
* 谓语：don't know
* 宾语：the man
* 定语：who is wearing a pair of glass.修饰the man.
