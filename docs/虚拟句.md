# 虚拟句

(虚-假的，拟-假设；不可能发生的事情 or 和假设相反的；用来加强语气，表达强烈的情绪)

* 主将从现：(本来应该都是will，但是为了让句子逻辑的先后关系更加通畅，所以 rains 现在时更符合！)
* if it rains tomorrow, I will pick you up.（不是虚拟，因为有可能成立！）

## -- 对现在的虚拟

* 本应该是现在 I am you, were比was显得更离谱，但是为了突显假设，用错误的方式来表达一种更强烈的语气-强化语气-夸张手法
* 如果我是你，我就弄死他！
* If I were you, I would kill him.

* 如果我是个女的，我就嫁给他。
* If I were a girl, I would marry him.(虚拟写错的话，就更好理解：我不是要去做手术，而是一种仰慕之情。)
* If I am a girl, I would marry him.(所以一切可能发生的事情，必然发生or已经发生)

## -- 对过去的虚拟

* 如果你昨天（就已经）告诉我，我昨天就（已经会）来了。
* If you told me yesterday, I would came.（看单词yesterday是个时间点）
* If you had told me yesterday, I would have come.（和中文逻辑一样，相对于今天而来，是一个时间段，从昨天到今天，已经假设完成的状态）

## -- 对将来的虚拟

* 如果明天地球炸了，我也要和你在一起。（be to do 将会怎么做）
